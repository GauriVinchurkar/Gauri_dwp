Flood Prediction System Website

This project is a front-end implementation of an AI-Based Flood Prediction System designed to demonstrate how disaster preparedness and flood risk monitoring can be managed through a digital platform.

The system interface is inspired by research on AI-based flood prediction models and focuses on early warning, environmental data visualization, and risk assessment.
